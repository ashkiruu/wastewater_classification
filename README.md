## 🧠 Project Overview

This project builds an image classification pipeline that identifies what type
of waste an image contains. It uses Transfer Learning — reusing a MobileNetV2
model pretrained on ImageNet — and fine-tunes it for 10 waste categories.

**Why Transfer Learning?**
Training a deep CNN from scratch requires millions of images and days of
compute. MobileNetV2 already knows how to detect edges, textures, and shapes
from its ImageNet training. We reuse those weights and only teach it our
10 specific waste categories.

**Pipeline stages:**
  1. Data Preprocessing  →  split, augment, build tf.data pipelines
  2. Model Training      →  frozen base + fine-tuning phases
  3. Model Evaluation    →  classification report + confusion matrix
  4. Inference           →  single image + batch + real-time webcam

- **Folder used:** `archive/standardized_384/`
- **Total images:** 12,259
- **Split:** 70% train / 15% val / 15% test

| Class      | Total | Train | Val  | Test |
|------------|-------|-------|------|------|
| battery    | 756   | 529   | 113  | 114  |
| biological | 699   | 489   | 104  | 106  |

> ⚠️ Dataset is imbalanced — `trash` has 4x fewer images than `clothes`.
> Class weights were applied during training to compensate.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

```
Input (224, 224, 3)
  → mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input   [0,255] → [-1,1]
  → MobileNetV2 base (frozen)        154 layers, ImageNet weights
  → GlobalAveragePooling2D           (7,7,1280) → (1280,)
  → Dense(128, relu)
  → Dropout(0.3)
  → Dense(10, softmax)               10 class probabilities

Total params:      2,423,242
Trainable (Phase1):  165,258   (head only)
Non-trainable:     2,257,984   (frozen MobileNetV2)
```

**Training strategy:**
- Phase 1 — Base frozen, train classification head only (lr=0.001, 10 epochs)
- Phase 2 — Unfreeze top 30 MobileNetV2 layers for fine-tuning (lr=1e-5, 10 epochs)

**Callbacks:**
- `EarlyStopping` (patience=4, restores best weights)
- `ReduceLROnPlateau` (factor=0.5, patience=2)
- `ModelCheckpoint` (saves best val_accuracy only)

## 📊 Results

### Official Test Set (1,848 images)

**Overall Accuracy: 90.80%**

| Class      | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Accuracy |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| clothes    | 0.9658    | 0.9895 | 0.9775   | 98.9% ⭐ |
| shoes      | 0.9769    | 0.9679 | 0.9724   | 96.8%    |
| biological | 0.9900    | 0.9340 | 0.9612   | 93.4%    |
| battery    | 0.9550    | 0.9298 | 0.9422   | 93.0%    |
| paper      | 0.8479    | 0.9154 | 0.8804   | 91.5%    |
| metal      | 0.8050    | 0.9143 | 0.8562   | 91.4%    |
| cardboard  | 0.9000    | 0.8873 | 0.8936   | 88.7%    |
| glass      | 0.8846    | 0.8812 | 0.8829   | 88.1%    |
| plastic    | 0.8899    | 0.8050 | 0.8453   | 80.5% ⚠️ |
| trash      | 0.8462    | 0.7971 | 0.8209   | 79.7% ⚠️ |

**Top misclassification pairs:**
- plastic → glass (19 times) — shiny/transparent surfaces look similar
- glass → plastic (17 times) — symmetric confusion
- cardboard → paper (16 times) — similar flat materials
- plastic → metal (12 times) — reflective surfaces

### Real-World Manual Test (10 personal photos)

**Score: 7/10 (70%)**

The 20% gap between official (90.8%) and real-world (70%) is expected —
training images were standardized studio shots while test photos were
taken with a phone camera under natural lighting.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1 — Preprocess the dataset
```bash
python data_preprocessing.py
```
Splits the dataset into train/val/test and builds tf.data pipelines.
Output: `dataset_split/` folder with 3 subfolders.

### Step 2 — Train the model
```bash
python train_model.py
```
Runs Phase 1 (frozen) + Phase 2 (fine-tuning).
Output: `waste_classifier_mobilenetv2.keras`

### Step 3 — Evaluate the model
```bash
python model_evaluation.py
```
Generates classification report and confusion matrix.
Output: `confusion_matrix.png`

### Step 4 — Run inference on images
```bash
python inference.py
```
Edit the `IMAGE_PATH` or `test_images` list inside `main()` to test your own images.

## 📷 Real-Time Webcam

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/live and click **Start Camera**.

- The browser captures the camera and sends a small frame to `/predict` about 3 times per second
- Predicted class and confidence appear on screen
- Top-3 predictions shown with confidence bars
- Low-confidence results (< 60%) are shown in orange
- The last 10 predictions are averaged in the browser to eliminate flickering

The web app runs the model through **ONNX Runtime** (`waste_classifier.onnx`), not
TensorFlow, so it stays small enough to deploy. Re-generate it after retraining with
`python scripts/export_onnx.py` (install `requirements-train.txt` first).

---

## 🚀 Deploying to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub (the `archive/` and `dataset_split/` folders are git-ignored).
2. On [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) choose **Add New → Project** and import the repo.
3. Keep the detected **Flask** preset; no build or install command is needed.
4. Add an environment variable `SECRET_KEY` with any long random string.
5. Click **Deploy**. Both `/manual` and `/live` work (the camera needs HTTPS, which Vercel provides).

Or from a terminal: `npm i -g vercel`, then `vercel` (preview) / `vercel --prod`.

Uploads are classified in memory and never saved, and are limited to 4 MB.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Plastic and trash** are the weakest classes (80.5% and 79.7%) due to
   visual overlap with other materials and class imbalance.

2. **Real-world performance** drops ~20% compared to dataset accuracy due to
   differences in lighting, background, and camera quality.

3. **Webcam inference runs on CPU** — predictions may lag on older machines.
   Reduce `PREDICT_EVERY_N_FRAMES` if too slow, increase if too fast.

4. **Unknown classes** — if you show an object not in the 10 classes (e.g. food),
   the model will still predict the closest match. Watch the confidence score.
